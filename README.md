# HelloEngine

HelloEngine is a Game Engine made by videogame development students [Zhida Chen](https://github.com/Xidashuaige) & [Adrià Sellarés](https://github.com/AdriaSeSa).

This is a 3D game engine. The engine state is under development right now.
The goal is to create a complete game engine with Entity Component System, fast 3D rendering, resource manager, scripting language and other utilities.

Engine current state: Early in development (v0.1)
3D rendering available, but no mesh loading yet.
Scene structure created, but no Entity component system yet.
Added XML utilities to load Int, Float, Bool and String variables from a default XML file. This system is called QuickSave and mimics the PlayerPrefs system form Unity Engine.
